Useful Extensions for VS Code:
HTML Boilerplate
vscode-icons
JavaScript (ES6) snippets
Babel JavaScript
ES7 React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets
Babel ES6/ES7
Prettier - Code formatter


ECMAScript -> guideline language for every scripting language (w3c)
2015: ES6
ES7, ES8, ES9

let: locally scoped variable

create objects in JS:

a. Object literal
b. Object.create() method
c. constructor function

d. class keyword

class A{public int x;}
class B:A{}

B obj = new B();

Object to Object inheritance

HTML DOM:

<html>
<head>
   <title>
   </title>
</head>
<body>
   <div id='main'></div> //HTML Div Element
  <script..../>
</body>
</html>

document.getElementById('main')

window>
document-->
html and body

every object in JS is linked to another object via __proto__ property. that linked object acts as base object for th JS object you created.

every function that you write in JS is contextually bound to some object (by default Window object in web application and Global object in Node JS application)
again every constructor function is supplied one object by JS runtime, known as Prototype object of that constructor function
The prototype objects are generally linked Object function's prototype object
Prototype object acts as base object for every object that is created based on the constructor function call

chaining the objects in this way is known prototype chain

in JS Object to Object inheritance is provided/facilitated via prototype chain

create two classes:

developer: 
value properties:
name, id, basicPayment, daPayment, hraPayment, incentivePayment
functional properties:
calculateSalay()--> returns total salary

hr: 
value properties:
name, id, basicPayment, daPayment, hraPayment, gratuityPayment

functional properties:
calculateSalay()--> returns total salary

create an object each of those classes
place them in an array

calculate and print salary:
iterate through that array, pick up an object and then call printSalary function:

in order to print salary of any employee, create a function separately: printSalary(salaryFnRef)--> to display the total salary of any employee

DOT NOT PASS ANY EMPLOYEE REFERENCE TO THIS FUNCTION. JUST PASS EMPLOYEE'S CALCULATESALARY FUNCTION REFERENCE TO PRINTSALARY FUNCTION

web application
desktop application/native application (NodeJS)

Node JS: server side framework
create asynchronous, event-loop based application (using JS) which can run in a machine (reading data from or writing data into a file, create a RESTFul API server, etc...)

Node JS --> V8 engine

code in JS (A.js) ---> Node runtime (Common JS module loader) ---> V8 engine

code in JS (A.js) -- attaching with index.html ---> Browser runtime (Need module loader) ---> V8 engine

module and module format:
module--> simple API to expose members of a file (JS), so that they can be used from other files
format: Common JS, asynchronous module definition (AMD), universal module definition (UMD), System JS, ES6 module
loader: Require JS, systemjs.register()

a. convert ES6 module format code --> AMD module format code [browser doesn't support modular concept. even if you use Require JS as module loader, that might not be able to understand any format other than AMD]

b. convert ES6 featured code --> older version of JS code (<ES6) [reason: broswer incompatibility]

answer: transpiltaion
transpiler: a s/w which transpile your ES6 JS code into vanila/old JS code
different transpilers: Babel, TypeScript compiler, etc....

npm i @babel/core @babel/cli --save-dev

command: .\node_modules\.bin\babel src --out-dir build

a. parsing (A.js)
b. conversion (ES6 features-->old features)
c. print (A.js)

plugins: 
a. @babel/plugin-transform-modules-amd (converts ES6 module format to AMD module format)
b. @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties (allows to use class properties)

presets: 
a. @babel/preset-env (includes lots of plugins related to other new features except modules and experimental features)

npm i @babel/plugin-transform-modules-amd @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/preset-env --save-dev

.babelrc

1. download the app 
2. open in VS Code
3. type "npm i" in the terminal (to install the node packages)
4. in another terminal type "npm run compile"
5. open another terminal (or in the same terminal) type "npm run load"
6. to run the "test.js" file in the HRMS app, use "node .\playground\test.js"

the other application: "js-programming" can be simply opened in VS Code and index.html file can be double-clicked to open in the browser
